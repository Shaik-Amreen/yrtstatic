                Yesreal Technologies Private Limited is a software products enterprise focused on technology
                driven solutions in the areas of recruitment, talent optimization, skill development, and
                network-optimized retention for academic institutions. Yesreal Technologies Private Limited

                faculty members, research associates, and academic activity with all key compliance and
                performance management objectives in mind.
                A startup passes through different phases before it reaches an elevated growth stage. Chief
                Technology Officer (CTO) duties differ at every stage according to the changing dynamics of
                a startup.
                However, the role becomes more mature after passing every phase, but at the first few
                stages, CTO needs to be practical, while the last stage demands leadership and management
                skills.
                YRT Chief Technology Officer leads the technology / Software engineering department in YRT
                and he is responsible for developing technology and process to develop better product
                (topfaculty.com & YRT)
                CTO will set the technical direction and Architect for topfaculty.com development, create and
                execute a strategic plan for growth and development of topfaculty.com identify the exact

                The role of a YRT CTO is not the same as a CTO at a big, well-established company. Of course,
                the main scope of responsibilities stays the same – both are in charge of the technological
                development of the company. Still, the role of a YRT CTO is more associated with rapid growth
                rather than long-term planning. YRT demand a different approach, where the survival of the
                company rests on their ability to adapt and roll out new ideas quickly.<br>
                YRT CTO has both project management and technical skills. Even though they often take a
                backseat in terms of writing code, a CTO should have a thorough understanding of the
                development process to lead a software development team & Architect.

                <strong>Responsibilities of YRT Engineering Manager:
                </strong><br>
            </span>

            <span style=" font-size: 0.9rem;margin-top: 0.4rem ;text-align: justify ">
                The role of a YRT Engineering Manager is not the same as an Engineering Manager at a big,
                well-established
                company. Of
                course, the main scope of responsibilities stays the same – both are in
                charge of the technological development of the company. Still, the role of a YRT Engineering Manager
                is more associated with rapid growth rather than long-term planning. YRT demand a different
                approach, where the survival of the company rests on their ability to adapt and roll out new ideas
                quickly.<br>
                YRT Engineering Manager has both project management and technical skills. Even though they often
                take a backseat in terms of writing code, an Engineering Manager should have a thorough
                understanding of the development process to lead a software development team & Architect.
